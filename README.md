MyShop - WEB API .NET 8

Overview
MyShop is a RESTful Web API built with .NET 8, designed following best practices of REST architecture. The project is structured in layers to ensure scalability, maintainability, and clean code principles.

API Documentation
The API is documented using Swagger. You can access the API documentation via the following link: 
https://localhost:7146/swagger/index.html

Project Structure
The project is divided into multiple layers:

Presentation Layer (Controllers) - Handles HTTP requests and responses.
Application Layer (Services, DTOs) - Contains business logic and manages data transfer objects (DTOs).
Domain Layer (Entities, Interfaces) - Represents core domain logic and entity definitions.
Infrastructure Layer (Database, Repositories, Logging, Configuration) - Handles persistence, logging, and configurations.

Why Layers?
Separation of concerns - Each layer has a distinct responsibility.
Scalability - The architecture supports adding new features without affecting existing code.
Testability - Layers make it easier to write unit and integration tests.

Key Features
AutoMapper: Used for mapping between DTOs and domain entities.
Dependency Injection (DI): Services and repositories are injected using .NETâ€™s built-in DI to ensure loose coupling.

Asynchronous Processing: Implemented using async/await for scalability and performance.

SQL Database with Code First Approach: The database is managed using Entity Framework Core with migrations.

Configuration Management: App settings are managed through config files.

Global Error Handling (Middleware): Errors are logged and fatal errors are sent via email.

Request Logging: Every request is logged for analytics and rating purposes.

Caching of api requests.

Unit tests and integration tests. 

Database Setup
To set up the database, use the following commands:

# Add migration
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate

# Update database
dotnet ef database update
Running the Project
Clone the repository.
Restore dependencies:
dotnet restore
Run the application:
dotnet run

Clean Code Principles
The project follows clean code principles to ensure maintainability:
Meaningful variable and method names.
Separation of concerns.
Avoiding magic numbers and hardcoded values.
Proper exception handling.
